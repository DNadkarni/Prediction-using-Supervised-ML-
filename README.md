OBJECTIVE - Predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.

From the given dataset, predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.

ALGORITHM USED - Linear Regression

Linear regression is a sophisticated statistical modeling technique that elegantly unravels the intricate relationships between variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. It gracefully navigates through the data landscape, discerning the optimal straight line that best summarizes the underlying patterns and dependencies, thereby allowing us to make informed predictions and uncover valuable insights into the interconnectedness of phenomena.
